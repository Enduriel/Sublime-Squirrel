### Git Clone
I'm on Windows, so OS X and Ubuntu might not be 100% correct.

Open up your Sublime Text packages directory and clone the repository using the commands below:

*on Windows (using Git Bash):*

    cd ~/AppData/Roaming/Sublime Text/Packages
    git clone https://github.com/iAmRoland/Sublime-Squirrel.git Squirrel

*on OS X (are the paths correct?):*

    cd ~/Library/Application/Support/Sublime Text/Packages
    git clone https://github.com/iAmRoland/Sublime-Squirrel.git Squirrel

*on Ubuntu (other linux distors? are the paths correct?):*

    cd ~/.config/sublime-text/Packages
    git clone https://github.com/iAmRoland/Sublime-Squirrel.git Squirrel

### File Download
Go to the downloads section and download as ZIP. 

Open up your Sublime Text packages directory and the downloaded ZIP. 

Extract the contents of the ZIP into that directory and rename Sublime-Squirrel to Squirrel.
