## Note
This version has been significantly improved: 

* a large amount of additional syntax highlighting, the ability to recognize members, function definitions and many more.
* fixes the bad autoindent behavior with brackets in Squirrel
* 2 updated and modified themes (based off of: [One Dark](https://github.com/andresmichel/one-dark-theme) and [Material Monokai Dark](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme)) to fully take advantage of the variety of defined scopes.

## Installation

Download the source code as a ZIP. Then, change the extension of the zip file to .sublime-package (instead of Sublime-squirrel-master.zip it should now be Sublime-squirrel-master.sublime-package).

Open up your Sublime Text packages directory (%appdata%/Sublime Text/Installed Packages). 

Copy the file with the new extension to that directory.
